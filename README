Chunks is a minimalist CSS layout system.

* Only layout, no typography, reset or forms.
* Can be used for fluid layouts.
* Based on divisions, not on a grid.
* Less than 500 octets, a very small footprint on your bandwidth usage.
* Requires no ".last", ".lastUnit" or ".omega" rule. Leads to cleaner HTML.
* Tests are not showcase pages, but tests.

Works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and probably others.
It MAY work in IE, I don't have any machine capable of running it. If you want
to help, you can check the tests (test.html), make changes when appropriate,
and send me a pull request on GitHub.
